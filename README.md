Dataset:
The dataset is downloadable from this link:
https://www.cs.umd.edu/~vs/vews/

Python 2.7 is used for implementation

Execution: 

The preprocessing has already been executed and preprocessed dataset is already in the submitted files.

For training the model too, the classifier models are stored and readily present in the 
submitted files. If it has to be executed for any validation purpose, use the following cmd:

python training.py

For predicting a test data set on these classifier models, run the following cmd:

python predicting.py

All the results and explanations are in report.
